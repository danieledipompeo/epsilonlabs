Use cases:
	-- as a CS/1 student, when are my summative and formative assessments?
	-- as a CS/2 student, how does my teaching and assessment timetable look for different module combinations?
	-- as a lecturer, when are the deadline for the assessments that I am checking and setting?

Next steps:
	++ Write tests that drive me towards functionality needed for other tests (e.g., web.regions)
	-- Check that the examples still work
	-- Move to EMF. Add rationale to paper: Ecore DSL, EObject supports good reflection, EObject proxies...
		-- Need a class that can translate annotated ecore into a set of scrapers
		-- Scrapers need to produce instances of EObject
		-- Info carried by resource probably needs to be stored as annotations on EObjects instead
	-- Write a subclass of AbstractEmfModel that uses the Web/Ecore metamodel and scrapers
	-- Rewrite examples as EOL programs
	-- try scraping assessments from module descriptors -- will likely lead to new requirements
	-- lazy loading: scrape on demand
	
DSL:
	-- "direct" vs "indirect" features?
	-- package backed by >1 web app.
	-- single resource backed by more than one page from the same web app? More than one page from different web apps? 
	-- pagination
