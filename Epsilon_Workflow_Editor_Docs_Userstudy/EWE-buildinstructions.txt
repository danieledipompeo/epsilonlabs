== STEPS TO BUILD EWE FROM SCRATCH ==

1) Start with a blank GMF project, copy Ecore model from EWE project.
2) Use EuGENia to generate the GMF Editor from the Ecore model.
3) Create model folder and src-gen folder in generated EWE.diagram project.
4) Copy MANIFEST.MF from EWE.Diagram project in SVN so that all dependencies are in place. (contains dependencies on eef runtime and epsilon plugins for validation + generated EEF provider package export)
5) Copy Existing EEF models from EWE/models folder to EWE.Diagram model folder. (Changes are widgets for Task/NestedElement + Modifications after running fixeef.eol)
6) Copy ewe.impl.LoadEMFModelImpl class from EWE project in SVN (only one method modified) 
7) Copy ewe.diagram.part.EwePaletteFactory from EWE Diagram (Only nested element tool commented out)
8) Generate EEF source code from EEF Gen model.
9) Copy EWE diagram plugin.xml from EWE diagram project. (Existing tabbedProperty extensions removed and replaced with EEF generated ones and customized for GMF)
10) Copy EweDiagramEditor.java from EWE diagram project. (Contains integrations with EEF)
11) Copy ewe.diagram.workbench.*Action classes from EWEDiagram for Eclipse integration menu. Copy all scripts from EWE/model/ewescripts to this location as well.
12) Copy Icons from Epsilon_Workflow_Editor.edit/icons/full/obj16 to EWE.Edit project.
13) Copy EWE.Validation project from SVN (contains modified plugin + EVL script).
